# Radar_Simulation
Radar simulation for Digital Signals processing class RPI 2016

GOAL:
The goal of this project was to create a utility for those learning about radar and doppler
shifts to begin to understand how the input parameters aect the waveforms. The focus
of this project is on generating the raw doppler shifted, pulsed, radar signals received
by the radar, however, demonstration of techniques to process received signals has also
been developed.
